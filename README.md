# Election-result-analysis-(Political)
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of election results, leveraging Power BI for visual insights and SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal was to extract, clean, and model data to create an interactive dashboard, providing stakeholders with actionable insights into various election metrics.

## Overview
The Election Results Analysis project focuses on understanding voting patterns, candidate performance, and party success across various regions. By using tools like Power BI and SQL, the project delivers key metrics such as:

- Total Seats: Visual representation of all available seats.
- Party-wise Results: Breakdown of seats won by specific political parties.
- Winning Candidates and Margins: Insights into winning candidates and the margin by which they secured victory, segmented by state.
- EVM Votes vs. Postal Votes: Comparative analysis of voting methods.
- Seats Won by Each Party: Total number of seats won by different parties.
- Winners and Runners-up: Identification of the top two candidates in each race.
- Candidate with Maximum EVM Votes: Highlighting candidates who secured the highest number of EVM votes.

## Tools Used
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Power Query: To clean and transform raw election data.
- SQL: For performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating similar insights through queries.
- Data Modeling: Used to establish relationships between different datasets and ensure data integrity.

## Key Features
- Data Cleansing: Cleaned and structured the raw election data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Dashboard Development: Created an interactive dashboard, offering stakeholders a visual way to explore key election metrics.
- EDA with SQL: Performed exploratory analysis using SQL queries to validate results and discover trends.

## Visualizations
